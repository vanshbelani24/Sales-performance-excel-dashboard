📈 Key Business Insights

✅ Regional Performance Imbalance
North, East, and West each contribute roughly 25–27% of total sales.
The South region (~23%) underperforms relative to peers.
👉 Indicates untapped growth potential through targeted expansion strategies.

✅ Revenue vs Profit Disconnect
Clothing generates the highest revenue but delivers lower margins (~13–14%).
Furniture shows stronger profitability (~14–15%) despite slightly lower sales.
👉 High revenue does not always equal high profitability.

✅ Channel Effectiveness
The Online channel slightly outperforms Retail in both sales and profit.
👉 Suggests stronger scalability and operational efficiency in digital sales.

✅ Seasonal Demand Patterns
Sales peak during Q4.
Noticeable slowdown occurs in mid-year months.
👉 Highlights the need for demand-aware inventory and marketing planning.

✅ Sales Rep Contribution Gap
A small group of representatives drives a disproportionate share of revenue.
👉 Signals performance variance and coaching opportunities.

💡 Strategic Recommendations

🚀 1. Strengthen Underperforming Regions
Increase targeted marketing, partnerships, and localized promotions in the South to rebalance regional contribution.

💰 2. Prioritize High-Margin Categories
Promote Furniture and Electronics through:
Bundled offers
Upselling
Strategic inventory placement
Goal: Improve overall profit margin.

🏷️ 3. Optimize Clothing Pricing Strategy
Review discounting practices to prevent margin erosion while preserving volume.

🌐 4. Accelerate Digital Growth
Invest further in the Online channel to capitalize on its efficiency and scalability.

📦 5. Align Inventory With Seasonality
Prepare for Q4 spikes with proactive inventory planning to avoid stockouts and lost sales.
